# Welcome to yingyan797 frontend web application series for STEM and Data visualization
An experiment to make web deployment lightweight and easy. Below are some of my applications for STEM. Only HTML, CSS, and Javascript are used for all apps, so no backend server is needed.

## 1. Y-Astronomy Sun calculator and Visualization | https://yingyan797.github.io/no-backend/y-astronomy
A simplified extraction of the old version https://github.com/yingyan797/sun-calculator (which uses Python Flask). Like before, main calculations involve Sun time, height angle, direction, and sunrise/sunset. Besides, 3D graphics of the Sun's trajectory is also planned to be implemented here. 

## 2. Y-Chemistry Equation balancing | https://yingyan797.github.io/no-backend/y-chemistry
An improved version of https://github.com/yingyan797/y-chemistry. The current application supports both direct typing and virtual periodic table keyboard inputs (with shortcut keys) for equations to be balanced. Gaussian elimination algorithm is used for calculating coefficients, and the solution matrix will be displayed.

More apps under development.
