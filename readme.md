# Welcome to yingyan797 frontend web application series for STEM and Data visualization
An experiment to make web deployment lightweight and easy. Below are some of my applications:
## 1. Y-Astronomy Sun calculator and Visualization | https://yingyan797.github.io/no-backend/y-astronomy.html
A simplified extraction of the old version https://github.com/yingyan797/sun-calculator. Like before, main calculations involve Sun time, height angle, direction, and sunrise/sunset. Besides, 3D graphics of the Sun's trajectory is also planned to be implemented here. The current version contains only HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so no backend server is needed.
